The project is a combination of solutions and ideas accumulated over few years.
I would also like to note that some solutions that may have analogues were developed by chance :) but have the right to exist.

### Features

- *Speed* - some methods faster than jquery analogues (select, append ...)
- *JS as HTML* - control UI throught JSON objects
- *DOM API* - manage DOM objects without connecting other libraries
- *Async* - create and organize asynchronous objects
- *Binding* - organize objects interaction throught binding
- *Access* - hide or publish fields and methods of classes
- *Templating* - create views throught templates
- Many other good things ;)
